# Checkout-Flow-Optimization-Analysis
Hello!

In this project, I explored real checkout data from 365datascience.com. Using the raw data provided, I used SQL to query critical information for checkout flow analysis.
After exporting the queries to CSV files, I used Tableau to create visuals in search of patterns and trends.
